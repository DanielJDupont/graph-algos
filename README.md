## Featuring a React wrapper for anime.js

Based upon improving the existing anime.js react wrappers currently on npm.

The goal of this wrapper is to have lots of documented examples you can use in React quickly, and to be as easy and as general as possible for anyone to use in any product.

Written with @types/animejs support for all of us TypeScript users and with modern TypeScript immutable functional programing practices in React.
